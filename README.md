# Seder-Hayom
Repository for Seder Hayom, a daily planner web-app for CISC 4900 at Brooklyn College

Seder Hayom is designed to be the ultimate daily planner for Judaism. The interface is user-friendly, and sports many useful features, all in an intuitive display. Seder Hayom's main feature is its automatic _Seder_-calculator and tracker, which utilizes the vast library of the Sefaria application to provide accurate information and easy access to improve your _Sedarim_. You can decide how much you want to learn of a specific _Sefer_ a day, by a number of metrics.

For example, if you wanted to have a _Seder_ in _Gemarah Baba Kamma_, you can generate a _Seder_ of any number of **_daf(im)_ a day**, any number of **_amud(im)_ a day**, or pick a **date of completion**. Seder Hayom will instantly calculate and populate your daily schedule based on the metric you chose: If you chose a discrete **number of pages per day**, your daily schedules in the future will automatically contain that Seder as long as there are pages left for you to study. If you chose a **date of completion**, Seder Hayom will work out how many pages (or however the specfic text is indexed) you need to do a day to finish by then, and assign that number to your daily schedule until that date. If you miss a day of your _Sedarim_, don't worry! The app has an option reschedule your _Seder_ for the next day. 

Seder Hayom also allows you to add other tasks to your daily schedule, though you will have to add them manually. Unlike tasks for your _Sedarim_, these tasks can be removed individually.

The app is currently deployed at https://sederhayom.netlify.app/

Happy Learning!
